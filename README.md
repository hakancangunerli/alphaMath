## Enhancing Mathematical Problem Solving Ability of Large Language Models via Retrieval Augmentation Generation
Please follow the given steps to run our project.

- Before running these scripts:
1) Please setup your API Keys in ```config.yaml``` for OpenAI, Groq \& GCP.
2) Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3) Run ```python localtests.py``` to verify if the project setup has been done correctly.

- To test the baseline model, please run ```final_evaluation.ipynb``` by toggling different ```MAIN_SOLVER_LLM``` from the ```LLMS TO TRY``` list. 

- To test our model, please run ```final_evaluation_rag.ipynb```.
