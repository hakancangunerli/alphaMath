We know that $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ is small, since $2\\sqrt7=\\sqrt{28}$ is close to $5=\\sqrt{25}$, at least compared to $6=\\sqrt{36}$. When we add these together, the $\\sqrt7$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, $$(5+2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4+4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2+4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4$$ whereas $$(5-2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4-4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2-4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4.$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(5^4+6\\cdot5^2(2\\sqrt7)^2+(2\\sqrt7)^4)=2(625+4200+784)=11218.$$ Since the term we added, $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\\boxed{11218}$ is the closest integer to $(5+2\\sqrt7)^4$.",

In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.",
        "solution": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.",

Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",
